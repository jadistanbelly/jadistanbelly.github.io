## Machine Learning

Initially a final project for an Applied Machine Learning course I took however, I have tried to make it its own standalone document. Please look at the "final" pdf file as a starting point if needed. 

The purpose for this project is not only to show the use of various ML models on a dataset but also to code them at a step by step process instead of using popular R packages that do a lot of my manual coding internally in their functions.
