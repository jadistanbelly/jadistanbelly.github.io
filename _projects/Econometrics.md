# Econometrics

The second course I have taken using R where I could apply the statistical concepts learned throughout my degrees. It has been very insightful to not only understand the application to statistical models but also the method of interpretation to each model. This final project utilizes four data-sets to show important applications of Linear Algebra, OLS and Logit models, Confusion Matrix etc. in business like data. For example, analysis is done on data-sets regarding money supply and its link to inflation or on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that can explain the rate of return on a security.

The HTML file below of my project has been designed to be a standalone document however, if a reference is needed the attached PDF titled "Final" is a good outline/rubric. The data sets used is also available below.

Here are a few external resources that have been really helpful when taking Econometrics:
