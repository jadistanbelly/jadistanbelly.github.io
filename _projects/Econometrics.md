Econometrics
=====


The use of different datasets to explore various statistical concepts. This was originally considered my final assignment for an Econometrics course however, I have attempted to create it as its own standalone document. If a reference is needed, take a look at the pdf titled "Final". Attached is also a copy of the datasets used in my HTML file.

Here are a few external resources that have been really helpful when taking Econometrics:

  - [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html)
  - [Principles of Econometrics with R](https://bookdown.org/ccolonescu/RPoE4/)
