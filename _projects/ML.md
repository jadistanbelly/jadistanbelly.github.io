# Machine Learning

This course pushed me to really experience the ups and downs of programming, it is where I mostly learned R and the spark I needed to realize how much I enjoy Data Science and Analytics. Specifically, this final project applies a large sum of the topics covered in the course onto data regarding Wine and its chemical properties. Furthermore, the codes are done at a step by step process instead of solely using popular R packages that that do a lot of the manually coding internally in their functions. For example, Cross-Validation and Bootstrapping is done in annotated steps for an instructional approach in understanding the codes. Finally, majority of the codes are designed to parallel compute thus decreasing knitting time.

The HTML file below of my project has been designed to be a standalone document however, if a reference is needed the attached PDF titled "Final" is a good outline/rubric.
