# Machine Learning

This course pushed me to really experience the ups and downs of programming, it is where I mostly learned R and the spark I needed to realize how much I enjoy Data Science and Analytics. Specifically, this final project applies a large sum of the topics covered in the course onto data regarding Wine and its chemical properties. Furthermore, the codes are done at a step by step process instead of solely using popular R packages that that do a lot of the manually coding internally in their functions. For example, Cross-Validation and Bootstrapping is done in annotated steps for an instructional approach in understanding the codes.

The HTML file below of my project has been designed to be a standalone document however, if a reference is needed the attached PDF titled "Final" is a good outline/rubric.
