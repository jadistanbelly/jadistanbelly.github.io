## Econometrics 

The use of different datasets to explore various statisical concepts. This was originally considered my final assignment for an Econometrics course however, I have attempted to create it as its own standalone document. If a reference is needed, take a look at the pdf titled "Final". Attached is also a copy of the datasets used in my HTML file.
