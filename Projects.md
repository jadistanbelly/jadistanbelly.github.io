## Econometrics 

The use of different datasets to explore various statistical concepts. This was originally considered my final assignment for an Econometrics course however, I have attempted to create it as its own standalone document. If a reference is needed, take a look at the pdf titled "Final". Attached is also a copy of the datasets used in my HTML file.

Here are a few external resources that have been really helpful when taking Econometrics:

  - [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html)
  - [Principles of Econometrics with R](https://bookdown.org/ccolonescu/RPoE4/)

## Machine Learning

Initially a final project for an Applied Machine Learning course I took however, I have tried to make it its own standalone document. Please look at the "final" pdf file as a starting point if needed. 

The purpose for this project is not only to show the use of various ML models on a dataset but also to code them at a step by step process instead of using popular R packages that do a lot of my manual coding internally in their functions.
